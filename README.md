# Cabinet Office, including Number 10 Data Science (No.10 DS) and the Incubator for AI (i.AI) (CO) — Cross-Government AI Governance Framework

An architecture governance project using [ArcKit](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit) to design and govern the **Cross-Government AI Governance Framework** for **Cabinet Office**.

## Background

The Cabinet Office supports the Prime Minister and coordinates policy across government. The Number 10 Data Science team (No.10 DS) provides data science capability to Downing Street, while the Incubator for AI (i.AI) builds and deploys AI products across government departments. Together, they are developing a cross-government framework for responsible AI adoption, building on the AI Playbook and Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS).

## Project Scope
