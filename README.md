# Cabinet Office (CO) — Cross-Government AI Governance Framework

An architecture governance project using [ArcKit](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit) to design and govern the **Cross-Government AI Governance Framework** for the **Cabinet Office**.

## Background

The Cabinet Office supports the Prime Minister and ensures effective running of government. It coordinates policy across departments, drives efficiency and reform, and provides leadership on cross-cutting priorities. As AI adoption accelerates across government, the Cabinet Office is developing a cross-government governance framework to ensure consistent, responsible, and effective AI deployment — building on the AI Playbook, Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS), and Central Digital & Data Office (CDDO) standards.

## Project Scope

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **AI Governance Framework** | Cross-government governance structure for AI adoption, accountability, and oversight |
| **Departmental AI Readiness** | Assessment toolkit for AI maturity, capability, and governance in departments |
| **Cross-Government AI Register** | Central register of AI systems in use across government departments |
| **AI Ethics Board** | Governance structure for cross-cutting AI ethical decisions |
| **AI Skills & Capability** | Framework for AI skills development and workforce planning across Civil Service |
| **AI Procurement Standards** | Standardised approach to procuring AI services across government |
